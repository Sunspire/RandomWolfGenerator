## Roles
### Villager
__Active__: Day\
__Powers__: None

### Werewolf
__Active__: Night\
__Powers__ : Kills villagers

### Cupid
__Acive__: Night\
__Powers__: Chooses two villagers to make a couple.\
When one of them dies, the other one dies as well.\
If a villager is coupled with a werewolf and the villager is killed, the werewolf dies as well and vice versa.

### Witch
__Acive__: Night\
__Powers__: They posses two spells, one to raise the dead, one to kill a player.\
Each power can be used only once per session.
If the witch is killed by a werewolf, they cannot use their powers, but the GM can still pretend that they are alive.

### Priest
__Acive__: Day\
__Powers__: They can bless one player before the night phase. The blessed person cannot be killed.\
They can use their power only once per session.

### Hunter
__Acive__: Night\
__Powers__: Can kill a player once per session.\
They may choose not to kill anyone during a particular night. It is generally not recommended for the hunter to use their power on the first night of the game, as they may accidentally kill an important role such as the seer. By waiting for information during the daytime, they can make a more informed decision on a subsequent night. 

#### Seer
__Acive__: Night\
__Powers__: Can ask for a player's role to be revealed every night.
